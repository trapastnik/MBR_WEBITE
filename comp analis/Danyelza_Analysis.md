## 1\. Development History

### Origin at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

The development of naxitamab spans **30+ years of research** by Dr. Nai-Kong Cheung at MSK — one of the most sustained single-investigator translational medicine efforts in oncology.

| **1980s** | Dr. Cheung develops murine anti-GD2 antibody **3F8** at MSK |
| **Mid-1980s** | Clinical trials of 3F8 begin at MSK |
| **1990s–2000s** | Extensive clinical experience with 3F8 in hundreds of neuroblastoma patients at MSK |
| **2000s–2010s** | Development of humanized version **hu3F8** (naxitamab) at MSK to reduce immunogenicity |
| **2015** | Y-mAbs Therapeutics founded to commercialize MSK anti-GD2 portfolio |

### Key Scientific Details

- **3F8** (murine antibody) was the first-generation anti-GD2 developed by Dr. Cheung. Used at MSK for decades under compassionate use and clinical trial protocols. Never commercially approved by FDA.  
- **Naxitamab (hu3F8)** — humanized version with CDRs of 3F8 grafted onto human IgG1 framework. Reduced immunogenicity enabled more durable treatment.  
- Pivotal **Study 201** (hu3F8/GM-CSF trial) conducted at MSK demonstrated efficacy in relapsed/refractory patients.

### FDA Designations

- Accelerated Approval  
- Breakthrough Therapy Designation
